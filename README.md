# roster-events-system

It has come to my attention that the Events staff for the Volunteer organisation that I'm apart of are lacking an all encapsulsating and scalable system that enables them to do their jobs efficiently and effectively.

I've been looking for a project for a while now that I can start from scratch to prove that I can take the next step in Software Development, and believe this will be a good start to test my Python/Django skills from the ground up.
